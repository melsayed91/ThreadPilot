# ThreadPilot
![Build](https://github.com/melsayed91/ThreadPilot/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg)

A demo solution in **.NET 9** implementing **Clean Architecture**, **CQRS with MediatR**, and **modern engineering practices**.

It simulates two bounded contexts:
- **Vehicles**: manages vehicle data (lookup by reg number, batch lookup)
- **Insurance**: manages insurance policies and enriches them with vehicle details

The project demonstrates **testability, separation of concerns, feature toggling, centralized error handling, coalescing to avoid duplicate calls, and extensibility**.

## üìê Architecture

We follow **Clean Architecture** with four layers:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[API Layer] --> B[Application Layer]
    B --> C[Domain Layer]
    B --> D[Infrastructure Layer]

    subgraph API[Presentation / API]
      A1[Controllers / Endpoints]
      A2[Swagger + Health Checks]
    end

    subgraph Application[Application]
      B1[Use Cases - MediatR Commands/Queries]
      B2[Ports - Interfaces]
      B3[Pipeline Behaviors - Validation, Logging]
    end

    subgraph Domain[Domain]
      C1[Entities]
      C2[Value Objects]
      C3[Domain Exceptions]
    end

    subgraph Infrastructure[Infrastructure]
      D1[HTTP Adapters]
      D2[EF Core (Postgres)]
      D3[In-Memory Adapters]
      D4[Decorators - Feature Flags, Coalescing]
    end
```

### Why Clean Architecture?
- **Separation of concerns** ‚Üí testable and maintainable
- Frameworks (ASP.NET, EF, etc.) are details, not core
- Domain is pure C#
- Easier to extend (new APIs, workers, persistence) without touching business rules

### Why MediatR?
- CQRS request/response pattern (queries & commands)
- Centralized pipeline behaviors for validation & logging
- Keeps controllers thin ‚Äî orchestration belongs to use cases

### Why Feature Flipping?
Enables safe rollout of new features:
- **Vehicles API**: toggle endpoints (`/batch`) with `[FeatureGate]`
- **Insurance API**: toggle enrichment via decorator (short-circuits if disabled)

Flags are configured in `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "FeatureManagement": {
    "EnableVehiclesBatchEndpoint": true,
    "EnableInsuranceEnrichment": true
  }
}
```

### Why Coalescing?
Without it, multiple concurrent requests for the same car regs would trigger duplicate HTTP calls.

Using a `SingleFlightCoordinator`, concurrent requests for the same key are merged into one upstream call. This avoids the N+1 problem and reduces load on the Vehicles API.

Decorator chain for Insurance outbound calls:
```
FeatureGatedVehicleLookup        (outermost, skips if flag OFF)
  ‚Üí CoalescingVehicleLookupAdapter  (merges duplicates in-flight)
    ‚Üí VehicleLookupHttpAdapter      (real HTTP to Vehicles API)
```

## üöÄ Running the Solution

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK (for local development)
- Docker Desktop (for containerized deployment)

### Build & Run (Local)
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build

# Run Vehicles API (http://localhost:5011/swagger)
dotnet run --project src/Vehicles.Api

# Run Insurance API (http://localhost:5021/swagger)
dotnet run --project src/Insurance.Api
```

## üê≥ Docker Quick Start (Use it for running the demo)

Everything below runs via Docker & docker-compose ‚Äî no local .NET SDK required.

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS) or Docker Engine + Compose v2 (Linux)
- Ability to pull images from mcr.microsoft.com
- Host ports 8081 and 8082 open

### Quick Start
```bash
# Build and start (first run may take a few minutes)
docker compose up -d --build

# See containers
docker compose ps

# Tail logs
docker compose logs -f postgres
docker compose logs -f vehicles.api
docker compose logs -f insurance.api
```

**Note**: EF Core migrations run automatically on startup when `MIGRATE_ON_STARTUP=true`. Postgres databases are initialized via SQL in `infra/db/init/`.

### URLs
- **Vehicles Swagger**: http://localhost:8081/swagger
- **Insurance Swagger**: http://localhost:8082/swagger
- **Health Checks**:
   - Vehicles ‚Üí http://localhost:8081/health
   - Insurance ‚Üí http://localhost:8082/health

### Try it (curl)
```bash
# Vehicles: single lookup
curl -s http://localhost:8081/v1/vehicles/ABC123 | jq

# Vehicles: batch lookup (feature-flagged)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8081/v1/vehicles/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"regs":["ABC123","XYZ999","MISSING"]}' | jq

# Insurance: summary (enriched with vehicles)
curl -s http://localhost:8082/v1/insurances/19650101-1234 | jq

# Health checks
curl -i http://localhost:8081/health
curl -i http://localhost:8082/health
```

## Endpoints

**Vehicles API**
- `GET /v1/vehicles/{reg}` ‚Üí single vehicle by reg number
- `POST /v1/vehicles/batch` ‚Üí batch lookup (feature-toggled)

**Insurance API**
- `GET /v1/insurances/{personalNumber}` ‚Üí insurance summary, optionally enriched with vehicles

## üìä Seed Data

### Vehicles API
| RegNumber | Make   | Model   | Year | Vin     |
|-----------|--------|---------|------|---------|
| ABC123    | Tesla  | Model 3 | 2020 | VIN-A   |
| XYZ999    | Volvo  | XC90    | 2019 | VIN-X   |
| KLM456    | Toyota | Corolla | 2018 | VIN-K   |

### Insurance API
| Person Number | PolicyType     | MonthlyCost | VehicleRegNumber |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| 19650101-1234 | Pet            | 10 USD      | ‚Äì                |
| 19650101-1234 | PersonalHealth | 20 USD      | ‚Äì                |
| 19650101-1234 | Car            | 30 USD      | ABC123           |
| 19650101-1234 | Car            | 30 USD      | ABC123           |
| 19650101-1234 | Car            | 30 USD      | XYZ999           |
| 19700101-1111 | Pet            | 10 USD      | ‚Äì                |
| 19700101-1111 | PersonalHealth | 20 USD      | ‚Äì                |


## üß™ Testing

```bash
dotnet test
```

### Test Strategy

**Domain unit tests**: Entities + Value Objects (pure C#, fast feedback).

**Application tests**: MediatR handlers, validators, pipeline behaviors (validation/logging).

**Infrastructure tests**:
- EF Core with SQLite (fast translation checks)
- Migrations smoke with Testcontainers Postgres to validate schema + constraints
- HTTP adapters & decorators (coalescing, feature flags) with fakes

**API integration tests**: Boot real hosts via WebApplicationFactory<Program>. Replace EF/HTTP with in-memory fakes for deterministic behavior.

### Test Pyramid
- **Broad base of unit tests**
- **Fewer integration tests**
- **Only a handful of API tests** (end-to-end)

Coverage is collected in GitHub Actions and summarized in the build output.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

Centralized via ProblemDetails (RFC 7807):

| Exception              | HTTP Code | Title           |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| ValidationException    | 400       | Validation error|
| DomainException        | 422       | Domain error    |
| HttpRequestException   | 502       | Upstream error  |
| all others             | 500       | Server error    |

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

### Why a Batch Endpoint?

The assignment requires only two endpoints, but I implemented an optional `POST /v1/vehicles/batch` for two reasons:

**Performance realism**: In real systems, the Insurance service often needs multiple vehicle records at once. A batch call allows fewer TCP connections, fewer round trips, and better upstream optimization.

**Clear separation of concerns**: The public contract can remain "one vehicle by reg," while internal consumers (like Insurance) can use batch for efficiency. The batch endpoint is feature-flagged so you can disable it and still fully meet the brief.

### Making Single Lookups Performant

Even with only `GET /v1/vehicles/{reg}`, we can avoid the classic "N requests ‚Üí N upstream calls" bottleneck through:

**Client-side dedup + limited parallelism**: Before calling Vehicles, deduplicate regs (case-insensitive) and use `Task.WhenAll` with bounded parallelism to avoid stampeding the Vehicles API.

**In-flight de-duplication (SingleFlight)**: Already implemented as a decorator. If 10 requests for ABC123 arrive concurrently, only one upstream call is made; the rest await the same task.

**Caching via decorator**: Wrap the Vehicles port with a cache decorator. For demo data like vehicle metadata (rarely changes), a short TTL cache provides significant performance gains.

**Resilience & backpressure**: Polly retries with jitter, timeouts, and circuit breakers to protect the Vehicles API. Bulkhead patterns cap concurrent outbound calls.

## üß∞ Modern Engineering Practices

**Current**:
- Coalescing to dedupe concurrent calls
- Feature flags for safe rollout
- MediatR pipeline for validation/logging
- EF Core with migrations & seed data

**Roadmap**:
- Resilience with Polly: retry (with jitter), circuit breaker, timeouts
- Caching: decorator with IMemoryCache or Redis; edge cache via gateway/CDN
- Observability: OpenTelemetry traces/metrics/logs ‚Üí Grafana Tempo/Loki/Prometheus; correlation IDs

## üîí Security (Roadmap)

**Current**: Centralized error handling ‚Üí 400 validation, 422 domain, 502 upstream, 500 server.

**Next steps**:
- AuthN/Z: JWT bearer (Auth0/AWS Cognito/Azure AD) + policies/scopes
- Rate limiting: AddRateLimiter (fixed window/token bucket)
- Secret management: GitHub secrets for CI; AWS SSM/Secrets Manager in prod
- Headers/TLS: HTTPS redirect, HSTS, and secure headers (via middleware or gateway)

## üöö CI/CD & DevOps

**CI (present)**: GitHub Actions (build-and-test.yml): restore, build (warnings as errors), tests, coverage, artifacts.

**CD (TODO) ‚Äì AWS example**:
- Infra with AWS CDK: VPC, ECS Fargate (or App Runner), ALB, RDS Postgres, ECR repos, SSM/Secrets
- Pipeline: Build and push images to ECR, aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials, cdk deploy

## üß© Extensibility

### Edge Cases Handled
- **Missing vehicles** ‚Üí policy still returned, vehicle = null
- **No insurances** ‚Üí empty list, cost = 0
- **Multiple insurances** ‚Üí aggregated monthly cost, deduplicated vehicle lookups

### API Versioning
- Current APIs use `/v1/...`
- Future versions can live alongside `/v2/...` without breaking clients


## üìå TODO Roadmap
- [ ] CD to AWS via CDK (ECS/App Runner + RDS)
- [ ] Caching (infra decorator or edge cache)
- [ ] Resilience with Polly (retry, circuit breaker)
- [ ] Rate limiting (AddRateLimiter)
- [ ] Security (auth, headers, secrets mgmt)
- [ ] Observability (OpenTelemetry ‚Üí Grafana stack)
- [ ] Makefile (`make up`) for one-command run

## üõ† Developer Onboarding

### Local Development
1. Clone the repo & install .NET 8
2. Run the APIs locally (`dotnet run`)
3. Explore Swagger:
   - Vehicles ‚Üí http://localhost:5011/swagger
   - Insurance ‚Üí http://localhost:5021/swagger
4. Use seed data above to try requests
5. Run tests (`dotnet test`)

### Docker-only Development
1. Clone the repo
2. Start the stack: `docker compose up -d --build`
3. Explore Swagger:
   - Vehicles ‚Üí http://localhost:8081/swagger
   - Insurance ‚Üí http://localhost:8082/swagger
4. Try the sample curl requests
5. Run tests using the SDK container (no local SDK needed):
   ```bash
   # bash/zsh (macOS/Linux):
   docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" -w /src mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0 dotnet test
   
   # PowerShell (Windows):
   docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/src" -w /src mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0 dotnet test
   ```
6. Stop: `docker compose down`

## üîç Architecture Decisions

- **MediatR** for orchestration (CQRS)
- **Pipeline Behaviors** for Validation & Logging
- **ProblemDetails** for consistent error responses
- **Ports/Adapters** to keep APIs decoupled
- **Feature Flags** for safe rollout
- **EF Core** with Postgres for persistence
- **Coalescing** (SingleFlight) to merge concurrent outbound calls

## ü§ñ How AI Helped

AI was used during development to:
- **Bootstrap boilerplate**: e.g., pipeline behaviors, DTOs, Swagger setup
- **Testing support**: generating unit + integration test scaffolds quickly
- **Code generation**: repetitive DI extension methods, ProblemDetails handler
- **Performance ideas**: guiding the implementation of coalescing to avoid duplicate HTTP calls
- **Docker setup**: generating compose configurations and Dockerfiles

It accelerated delivery but all code was reviewed, refined, and adapted manually to ensure correctness and clarity.

## ü§î Personal Reflection

In my current role, we also use Clean Architecture and microservices, so this assignment felt familiar. The most interesting part was tackling performance and avoiding N+1 queries, especially through coalescing and batching. The EF integration stayed clean by mapping at the infrastructure edge and keeping the domain pure.

If I had more time, I'd implement the remaining TODOs (CD with CDK, resilience with Polly, caching decorators, and observability) to make the solution closer to production-ready.

## üöÄ CI/CD

CI runs on every push/PR:
- Build with warnings-as-errors
- Run all tests
- Collect coverage
- Publish summary in GitHub Actions UI
